# PRD Template

Use this template to define product requirements before implementation begins.
The goal is shared clarity on user value, scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

## 1. Problem Statement
- What user or business problem are we solving?
- Why does this matter now?
- What is currently failing or missing?

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals
- Goals: measurable outcomes this project must deliver.
- Non-Goals: explicitly out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep.

## 3. Users and Use Cases
- Primary user segments.
- Key workflows this change enables.
- Edge cases and failure modes to consider.

## 4. Requirements
- Functional requirements listed as testable statements.
- Non-functional requirements: performance, reliability, security, cost.
- Data and compliance requirements.

## 5. Success Metrics
- Quantitative metrics and target thresholds.
- Leading indicators and lagging indicators.
- Measurement plan and reporting cadence.

## 6. Delivery Plan
